:computer: :books: :pencil: :closed_lock_with_key: :school:
This repository is to show the domain's ontology editor.

CMEditor was developed to allow the creation of concept maps, either context-free or contextualized. The great advantage of this editor in relation to other types of map editors is the opportunity to create a contextualized map, that is, maps created from a framework of concepts previously present in a domain ontology provided by a teacher.

The tool created was developed through of jgraph library.
